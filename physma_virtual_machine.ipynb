    "## Create your own virtual machine\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and install the [virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org) software.\n",
    "2. Download a suitable linux distribution. A linux distribution or distro is the Linux kernel (the core of the operating system) packed together with any selection of application programs, such as the desktop environment, terminal programs, editors etc. We want something light with a simple user interface which does not distract us from the task at hand; a good solution is [lubuntu](<http://lubuntu.net>) - a lightweight member of the Ubuntu family of Linux distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Download the 64-bit `/iso` image from the [lubuntu download page](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/GetLubuntu). An `.iso` image is a format of a big chunk of data that one used to write to CD. Now it serves as a container that can be used to package up larger amounts of data and move it from one place to another. These images can be mounted into the filesystem of the operating system and appear as if they are a separate hard disk. Other operating systems know other image file formats, such as `.dmg` on Mac OS.\n",
    "3. Start building a new guest OS (Start with the new button and follow the pre-defined build path suggested by the succession of GUIs, and adopt the defaults; at some point you have to select the downloaded `.iso` image file as the installation source). For instructions on booting your virtual box from an `.iso` image, check [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/64915/how-do-i-install-ubuntu-on-a-virtualbox-client-from-an-iso-image).\n",
    "4. Possible **pitfalls**: \n",
    "    * make sure you select _Linux_ and _64-bit Ubuntu_ system early on when you create the Guest OS\n",
    "    * increase the size of your hard drive to 20GB if possible, otherwise you have to add a virtual disk later \n",
    "    * my virtualbox had display issues, which were remedied by the first solution described [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/541006/ubuntu-14-10-does-not-install-in-virtualbox/542835#542835) .\n",
    "5. Once your new Ubuntu guest OS system is installed you need to configure it. [For example you should install _Guest Additions_](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html) to get better video resolution and other good things. Possible **pitfalls**: \n",
    "    * You have to reboot to activate the additions. \n",
    "    * You have to install the kernel extensions (`dkms`) see below, _and_ you have to mount the Guest Additions CD _and_ you have to install them! Follow the instructions precisely all the way to the end!!\n",
    "    * you may have to use `sudo` to execute the install command as super user, see below.\n",
    "    * _Check if it works:_ If you resize the VM window and the desktop resizes with it then it works. \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. You may want to use the software installation tool to uninstall things to make your system lean and small. In the next section we cover how to install into your virtual machine the special software packages we will need."

    "## Configuration and maintenance of the _physma_ VM\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux command line\n",
    "To open a command prompt in Lubuntu, click the lower left icon on the screen, then choose LXTerminal from the System Tools menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have never used a UNIX-style command line before, spend a couple of minutes reading [this page](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php) to get an idea of what it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing software packages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**  Make sure your _physma_ VM has internet access! For this your host OS needs internet access.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linux OS software\n",
    "There are several graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for managing software packages. Often a quicker path to success involves the command line interface (CLI) tool `apt`. As with most Unix/Linux command line tools you can use the `man` command to view the manual page:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "physma$ man apt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example `physma$` is the command prompt and `man apt` is what you actually type, followed by hitting the `Return` key. Sometimes the prompt is just `$`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "When you follow the instructions to install the _Guest Additions_ you will need to install kernel extensions. This is done with the `apt` package manager:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install dkms\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move along we will install more things that we may need, such as:\n",
    "* the LaTeX typesetting package\n",
    "* a fortran or C compiler\n",
    "* additional image or movie processing software\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case search for the requested program and then install it. The latter we may have to do as _root_ user (superuser) using the `sudo` command prefix. In this way the new program will be available to all users with accounts on your _physma_ VM (this relates to the multi-user nature of the Linux OS, even if we do not yet need this feature now).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need the `git` command line program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ apt search git\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "** Example 2:**\n",
    "We may need at some point some image manipulation software, e.g. to convert one image format into another:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ apt search \"image manipulation programs\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "This returns some list, and you may then decide to install one of them:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first command gives a list of all packages containing, using, being related to or providing the software. The second command installs the packages and all required dependencies. Actually installing a package must be done as super-user, or as we do this here, with the little utility `sudo` which allows users (in this case the user past) to do certain things as _su_-peruser. Again, use the `user` password.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mounting a directory from your host system\n",
    "This is extremely useful for a number of reasons:\n",
    "* enlarge the available disk space dynamically without having to dedicate host disk space to the guest OS \n",
    "* share files with your host system where they would be available for further processing, editing, emailing etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how it works:\n",
    "1. shut-down your VM\n",
    "2. open settings in VirtualBox software\n",
    "3. select the shared folders tab and add a folder for sharing (this should be a folder that exists on your laptop OUTSIDE of your VM--create one just for this purpose if you want), select _auto-mount_: ![it should look like this](./images/share_folder_1.jpg)\n",
    "4. boot the VM\n",
    "5. install the virtualbox addons by entering the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms\n",
    "```\n",
    "6. in the VM, create in your home directory a file which will be the mount point for your shared folder: `$ mkdir mnt`\n",
    "7. link the new `mnt` directory to the shared folder at the command line:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 mnt /path/on/my/VMhome/tmp\n",
    "```\n",
    "8. use `$ df -h` to check your newly mounted volume, use `cd` to go to the mnt dir and check that you can read and write files\n",
    "9. you can identify a folder in your home directory that uses a lot of space and move it to the newly mounted volume. If you want to make a symbolic link from the moved dir to your home dir you can use the `ln -s` command, use `man` to check it out, it works like the `cp` command.\n"
