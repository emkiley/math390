For each assignment, you create a new directory called exactly what the header of the assignement is (without the markup #). So in this case the directory in your repo would be called `Assignment_0`. Your repo with the assignment added must be pushed to the bitbucket remote before the due date/time. Since some automated processes will then pull all assignment repos for all students, you must submit on time. Late submissions require extra manual work and carry an automatic 20% grade deduction.\n",

    "\n",
    "(2) In class we have seen implementations of the mid-point rule and Simpson's 3/8-method to approximate integrals. One of the key features of these methods (especially useful when your function comes from measured data) is that the technique uses as its input **only** the values of $f(x)$ at a finite number of points.  Sometimes one has access to **more** information about $f$ than simply its values.  In this problem, we ask you to write a script to approximate integrals numerically, but where one has a **symbolic** expression for $f$, and therefore using sympy, one also has access to $f'$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Fact** Given an interval $[a,b]$ and numbers $f_a, f'_a, f_b, f'_b$ there exists one (and only one) cubic polynomial $p(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3$ such that $$p(a) = f_a, \\ \\ p'(a) = f'_a, \\ \\ p(b) = f_b, \\ \\ p'(b) = f'_b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, one can solve for $c_0,c_1,c_2,c_3$ fairly easily.  The above equations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c_0 + c_1 a + c_2 a^2 + c_3 a^3 = f_a \\ [eq.1]\\ \\ c_0 + c_1 b + c_2 b^2 + c_3 b^3 = f_b \\ [eq.2] $$\n",
    "$$c_1 + 2c_2a + 3c_3a^2 = f'_a \\ [eq.3] \\ \\ c_1 + 2c_2b+3c_3b^2 = f'_b \\ [eq.4] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "a little manipulation and one gets to the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pmatrix{ c_2 \\\\ c_3} = \\frac{1}{(a-b)^3} \\cdot \\pmatrix{ 3(b+a) & -2(b^2+ba+a^2) \\\\ -2 & b+a} \\cdot \\pmatrix{ f_a - f_b + bf_b' - af_a' \\\\ f_b' -f_a'}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the middle expression is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix. From the above one can solve for $c_0$ and $c_1$ by back-substituting into [eq.1] and [eq.3] (or [eq.2] and [eq.4], your choice). \n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the accuracy of this method to the mid-point and Simpson 3/8-method, for the computation of the integral $\\int_0^\\pi \\sin(x) dx = 2$. Try the number of intervals $n=10, 100, 1000$ for all three methods. \n",
