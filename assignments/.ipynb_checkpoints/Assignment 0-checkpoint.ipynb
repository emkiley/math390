In order to give you a chance to practice, please work through and submit _Assignment 0_. It will not be graded, but I will look at it and provide general feedback via e-mail.\n",

    "Assignments are added to your [own repository that you share with the instructors and TAs](https://github.com/emkiley/math390/Topic_02.ipynb). For each assignment, you create a new directory called exactly what the header of the assignement is (without the markup #). So in this case the directory in your repo would be called `Assignment_0`. Your repo with the assignment added must be pushed to the bitbucket remote before the due date/time. Since some automated processes will then pull all assignment repos for all students, you must submit on time. Late submissions require extra manual work and carry an automatic 20% grade deduction.\n",

See the [Pro Git book](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for reminders about how to remove files from your git repository.\n",
