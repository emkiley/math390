    "## Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem we will ask you to perform three tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write functions that produce various $2 \\times 2$ numpy matrices. \n",
    "     * A function R that takes an argument t, which returns the matrix that performs counter-clockwise rotation by t radians. \n",
    "     *  A function M that takes an argument t, which returns the matrix that performs mirror-reflection across the line through the origin that has angle t with the x-axis. \n",
    "     *  A function S that takes an argument t, which returns the matrix that scales the x-coordinate by t, and leaves the y-coordinate fixed. \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Write a function that checks to see whether or not the identity $$M(t/2)M(0) = R(t)$$ is holds (if not, it should at least hold to **high degree of precision**), and check for at least $5$ different values of $t$ with $0 < t < \\pi/2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Generate a plot of the function $y=\\cos(x^2)$ in the plane, with $-1 \\leq x \\leq 3$.  Use matplotlib to plot it, together with a rotation and mirror reflection (choose a $0 < t < \\pi/6$) and a scaling (with $t=1/3$).  Use different colours for the transformed graphs."

    "\n",
    "A nuclear network code is another example of solving a coupled system of ODEs. Imagine a situation where you have a number of constituents which can react with each other pairwise and form a new constituent. That's a network of constituents in which the transmutation through reactions is described by rate equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Energy in stars is generated by nuclear reactions between different isotopes of elements. This is described by nuclear network code.\n",
    "The first  reactions of the CN cycle for hydrogen burning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $^{12}\\mathrm{C}+^{1}\\mathrm{H} \\rightarrow ^{13}\\mathrm{N}+\\mathrm{\\gamma}$ followed immediately by the $\\beta$ decay of $^{13}\\mathrm{N}$ to $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$\n",
    "* $^{13}\\mathrm{C}+^1\\mathrm{H} \\rightarrow ^{14}\\mathrm{N}+\\mathrm{\\gamma}$ and\n",
    "* $^{14}\\mathrm{N}+^1\\mathrm{H} \\rightarrow ^{15}\\mathrm{O}+\\mathrm{\\gamma}$ followed immediately by the $\\beta$ decay of $^{15}\\mathrm{O}$ to $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$\n",
    "* $^{15}\\mathrm{N}+^1\\mathrm{H} \\rightarrow ^{12}\\mathrm{C}+^4\\mathrm{He}$ which closes the CN cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate coefficients that describe how quickly the transmutations occur, are dependent on the temperature. To described this generally you have to take the coeffiecient as a function of T from a table and interpolate appropriately. Here you are asked to initially only enter the rate coefficients for one constant T.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a nuclear network code for the CN cycle that operates at a fixed temperature of $T=9\\times10^{7}\\mathrm{K}$ and a density of $\\rho = 100 \\mathrm{g/cm^3}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution of each **species** or **constituent** is governed by a rate equation that has on the right-hand side the sum of all production and destruction terms. In terms of the number density $N_j$ of species $j$ we collect all\n",
    "production and destruction terms of reactions of the type $k + l\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dN_j}{dt} = N_k N_l<\\sigma v>_{kl,j} - N_j N_m <\\sigma v>_{jn,o} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $<\\sigma v>$ is the reaction rate (the product of the cross section and the\n",
    "relative velocity in the center-of-mass system averaged over the\n",
    "appropriate distribution function) that can be obtained from the [NACRE compilation](http://www.astro.ulb.ac.be/nacreii). \n",
    "\n",
    "The number density is expressed in terms of a number fraction or mole\n",
    "fraction $Y=X/A$ ,with $A$ the atomic mass number and $X$ the mass\n",
    "fraction, by $N=Y \\rho  N_\\mathrm{A}$ where $N_\\mathrm{A}$ is\n",
    "the Avogadro number. The rate given in the NACRE tables is in terms of \n",
    "$  N_\\mathrm{A} <\\sigma v>$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inital abundances in terms of the mass fraction according to the solar abundance distribution are provided in the file `iniab1.4E-02As09.ppn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the equillibrium state of the CN cycle in terms of the abundance ratios of the C and N isotopic ratios?\n",
    "2. How long does it take to reach that equillibrium?\n",
    "3. How long does it take to burn 10% of the initially available H?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus point\n",
    "Generalize your code that it works for a user specified temperature in a  given range. You will have to provide a suitable interpolation formula to your code so that the terms involving the rate can differentiated."
