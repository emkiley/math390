    "In a software team, exchange of information and technical skills requires continuous communication. E-mail is a one-to-one communication which does not work well when questions and answers are likely of more general interest, and if more than one person in the group could provide an answer. Instead, a chat room serves the purpose better. In this class, you will try hard to not e-mail the instructor, but instead ask and get answers in a chat room. The instructor will monitor the chat room. We will use the public XMPP-based peer-to-peer network called \"jabber\".\n",

    "Sign up for an XMPP ID at an XMPP server of your choice. [This one works well](https://jabber.hot-chilli.net/forms/create/create.php).\n",

    "When you installed lubuntu on your VM, several applications were installed for various things. For example, Firefox was installed as the web browser, and AbiWord was installed as a word processor. One program that was installed is called Pidgin, and it is used for chat accounts. Start Pidgin by finding it in the \"Internet\" submenu ([screenshot](https://github.com/emkiley/math390/blob/master/images/jabber_whereis.png)).\n",

    "Enter your user information [like in this screenshot](https://github.com/emkiley/math390/blob/master/images/jabber_account_setup.png), making sure you use your own username (and the name of the XMPP server you chose, if it wasn't the same one I chose). Enter your password if you want.\n",

    "When you are logged in, join our chat room by selecting Buddies > Join a Chat, and enter our chat room's address [like in this screenshot](https://github.com/emkiley/math390/blob/master/images/jabber_joinchat.png). Your \"Handle\" can be anything you want, but it's helpful if your classmates and instructors can identify you.\n",
