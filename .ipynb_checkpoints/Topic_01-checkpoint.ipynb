    "## Main ways in which scientists and mathematicians use computers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "Data is generated all the time when experiments or simulations are carried out. Confronting both with each other or with models involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* moving, storing, archiving data\n",
    "* analyzing data (including statistical analysis--see below)\n",
    "* modelling data\n",
    "* visualizing data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "If we understand the physics, then the real world should resemble the correct solution of the appropriate laws of nature, such as the **Conservation Laws**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* energy\n",
    "* momentum\n",
    "* mass\n",
    "* charge\n",
    "\n",
    "Then solve the relevant fundamental laws of physics. Real-world problems have some challenges though:\n",
    "\n",
    "* multi-physics: simultaneously include different physics components, such as conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy as well as Maxwell's equations for a magneto-hydrodynamics problem\n",
    "* multi-scale: processes on vastly different temporal and spatial scales are simultaneously important and interacting\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical simulations combine the above challenges in ways that are impossible with purely analytical approaches. Simulations of high quality are numerical experiments that reveal the complex and non-linear behavior of the appropriate combination of physics laws. This approach provides scientific insight in ways that complement traditional theory and physical experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving mathematical problems **numerically** (as opposed to analytically). Examples include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* integrating a function or differential equation\n",
    "* finding the root of an equation\n",
    "* solving a linear algebra problem with many variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Although many would associate _data_ with statistics, I would put it here too. Applying a statistical analysis requires lots of methods and techniques of numerical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbolic computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the availability of powerful simulation codes (e.g., COMSOL, ANSYS, CST, etc.) and libraries (e.g., SciPy, NumPy) to rapidly deploy proven methods in numerical analysis, we need to be able to work with complicated mathematics in an analytical fashion. The laws of physics come in the language of mathematics, and we need to _speak_ that language to understand physics and to write down new physics insights. Symbolic computing is a powerful way to support that. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utilities\n",
    "There are numerous tasks that we have to be familiar with that are common to more than one of the above roles, or that make our lives simpler:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. reading and writing data (input/output, or \"IO\") \n",
    "2. visualizing, plotting data\n",
    "3. programming\n",
    "3. (distributed) version control\n",
    "4. documentation and sharing software\n",
    "5. networking & storage\n",
    "6. using libraries (e.g., for numerical analysis!)\n",
    "8. parallel/threaded computing\n",
    "9. debugging techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "__In this course it is the goal that you obtain an introduction to all of the above by looking at specific physics examples.__"

We want to have all the same system so that we are not bogged down too much by technical problems. Each of us will create a virtual machine for that purpose. There are many virtualization technologies out there. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) is a freely available tool that works very well. A virtualization software provides a virtual computer into which we can install a variety of different operating systems, such as various flavors of Linux. Linux is a UNIX-like operating system (OS) and serves well as a teaching platform. All the tools that we will need are available as open source or feely downloadable. At the end of this class your personal virtual machine will be a useful tool that allows you to perform many tasks during your further undergraduate education, and beyond!\n",
